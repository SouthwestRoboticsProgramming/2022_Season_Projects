# 2022 Season Projects

This is where we will keep our projects that we work on this season.

# Current Projects

### RobotVisualizer
A graphical program that allows visualizing of values inside the robot.
These values can include things such as predicted position, obstacle detection, and pathfinding paths.

### TaskManager
A set of libraries that make working with coprocessors easier.
Allows starting, stopping, and deploying tasks to coprocessors.
See the readme in TaskManager for more details.

### Vision
Uses OpenCV to manipulate webcam inputs. So far this has been implemented to detect balls.

### Lidar
A library and a task for interfacing with a RPLidar A1M8 lidar sensor. The API is fully asynchronous to make it easier to incorporate into tasks.

### Pathfinding
A library that allows the robot to autonomously calculate paths through the environment.

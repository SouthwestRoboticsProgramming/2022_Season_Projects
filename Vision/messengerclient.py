    Allows interfacing with the robot-wide messaging service, Messenger.

    and share data with each other.

    This communication is done through messages. A message consists of a
    string indicating the type and a bytes object, which can contain any
    arbitrary data. A client can choose to listen to any type of message, and
    will only receive messages they have explicitly listened to.
